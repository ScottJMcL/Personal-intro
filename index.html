    <!-- Introduction section -->

    <section class="intro">
        <p>My name is Scott McLaughlin, and I am an Electrical Engineer by training. 
            For the last 10 years, I have been working in the Program Management 
            Office for a consumer electronics company.  During this time, I found 
            that I enjoyed scripting and coding much more than the program management 
            activities.  Hence, coming to Coding Temple. I am embarking on my third 
            career, having first worked with special ed kids for a decade or so, 
            before going back to school to get a Bachelors and Masters from UC Irvine. 
            At the moment, I am between jobs, having been laid off from my last employer.
        </p>
        <p>I chose the Data Analytics track because I want to work in healthcare 
            or a related field, helping to widen knowledge that can improve health 
            outcomes.  Hopefully a job in this industry will not just turn into 
            crunching numbers to maximize profits. That would be VERY depressing, 
            and I wouldd likely move on to a different company.
        </p>
        <p>
            I live in Arcadia, CA with my wife and five year old boy, who is in a 
            wonderful kindergarten. On the next page, you will see far too many 
            pictures of them; I am a proud husband and daddy. In the past, I have 
            been into martial arts (Aikido), rock climbing, and some SCUBA diving. 
            I have also been into the Renaissance fair, being a member of a group 
            that performs at smaller fairs and other events. Due to work pressures 
            and, of course, the pandemic, none of that goes on anymore. :-(  I do 
            still enjoy a good game of billiards, and occasionally head over to a 
            local billiards hall for fun.
        </p>
        <p>
            I look forward to the days when I can go to more events in the 
            Arcadia / Pasadena area, make more friends, and maybe join a Dojo or 
            a billiards league.
        </p>
        <p>
            While I'm doing the Bootcamp thing, I'm still looking for employment
            with my Program Management background.  If you have any leads, please
